## Projects
### 🛒 Conventia – Marketplace developed in WordPress and PHP                 cooventia.com
Conventia is a marketplace developed using WordPress, where multiple commercial functionalities were implemented through strategic use of plugins and custom code.

📦 Key plugins: WooCommerce was used as the core for product and transaction management, with YITH plugins to extend features like wishlists, multi-vendor support, and advanced filters.

🎨 Theme customization: Existing themes were modified to match the client’s branding and design specifications, adapting styles and structures using custom stylesheets and theme editor adjustments.

🔧 PHP integration: Extensive use of PHP to customize plugin interactions with the theme. This included:

- Creating custom hooks and shortcodes to display dynamic content.  
- Modifying the functions.php file to extend WooCommerce behavior.  
- Injecting additional logic into theme templates to handle conditional behaviors based on user or product types.

🧱 Custom HTML blocks: The WordPress block editor was used to insert custom HTML sections, giving greater visual and functional control over key pages such as product details, checkout, and vendor profile.
